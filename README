<h1>Introducing the Social Scores API</h1>

<p>The social scores api is an easy way for iOS developers to add Facebook Friend based, or "social" scoreboards into their mobile games.</p>
<h3>Make your game a social experience!</h3>
<p>Within your existing iOS game, after a user beats a particular level, in two lines of code the users' score gets saved and he is presented with a scoreboard showing him how his score ranks amongst all of his facebook friends and amongst the entire community.</p>
<p>If they want to brag about their high score, with the press of a button they will be creating a facebook post showing off the scoreboard on their timeline. </p>
<p>This helps make your game a more social experience and also helps promote your app!</p>

<h3>Gain intelligence</h3>
<p>Log into the web app to view all users' scores for each level within your game.</p>
<p>View the names and email addresses of your users for marketing purposes.</p>

</ul>
<h3>Step 4-  Copy Social Scores Files</h3>

<h3>Step 5-  Link Required Frameworks</h3>
<p>Add the following frameworks to your project</p>
<ul>

  <h1>Getting Started - Use it</h1>
  <h3>Show the Settings Controller</h3>
  <p>I have included a settings view controller to include in your project to allow the user to log in to facebook and to enable the Social Scores api.</p>
  <p>You can use this by simply pushing the provided SettingsController on a button press.</p>

  <h3>After a level is completed, call the API.</h3>
  <div class="code-box">
-(void) onLevelComplete{
   SocialScoresManager * scoreManager = [SocialScoresManager sharedManager];
   NSDictionary * options = [NSDictionary dictionaryWithObjects:[NSArray arrayWithObjects: [NSNumber numberWithInt:score], nil] forKeys:[NSArray arrayWithObjects:@"score", nil]]; <
   [scoreManager showTopScoresForLevel:@"Level 1" inViewController:self withOptions:options];
}
  </div>
  <p>This will save the player's score, and display a leader board for this level. The player will be able to see how their score ranks amongst their friends or the whole community. They will be able to share the scoreboard on their facebook wall.</p>
